**Virtual Lab** is a website designed to facilitate interactive education by providing a collection of scientific and mathematical experiments in a simulation environment. Students and teachers can explore concepts visually and interactively without the need for physical lab equipment.

The website includes:
- Experiment categories: **Sciences**, **Physics**, **Mathematics**, and **All**.
- A search bar for quick access to experiments.
- The ability to toggle between **Grid** and **List** views.
- **Dark Mode** with saved preferences.
- A responsive design that mimics the desktop experience on mobile devices (with horizontal scrolling).

---

## ✨ Features

- **Fully Arabic user interface** (right-to-left layout).
- **All experiments displayed** by default on page load.
- **Filter by subject** via category buttons (thumbnail image + title).
- **Instant search** – highlights results and scrolls to them.
- **User preferences saved** (dark mode, grid/list view) using Local Storage.
- **Stable links** – folders and files renamed to English to ensure compatibility with GitHub Pages.
- **Separate experiment pages** that can be updated later with real content.

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/syfd74582/School-lab.git
   ```
2. **Update links**  
   Inside `index.html`, make sure the experiment paths (`href`) point to the actual files on your device or GitHub.
3. **Upload files to GitHub**  
   Ensure all experiment folders and their images are uploaded.
4. **Enable GitHub Pages**  
   Go to `Settings > Pages` and select the main branch as the source. The site will be published at a URL like `https://your-username.github.io/repo-name/`.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Page structure.
- **CSS3** – Styling, variables, dark mode, flexbox/grid.
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Filtering, search, view toggling, preference saving.
- **Font Awesome** – Additional icons.

## 📝 How to Add New Experiments

1. Create a new folder for the experiment in the appropriate category (e.g., `physics/`, `math/`, or `science/`).
2. Place the experiment's `index.html` file inside the folder along with required images.
3. Open the main `index.html` and add a new `<li>` element in the appropriate section (Physics, Mathematics, or Sciences) with the updated `href` and image path.
4. Re-upload the files to GitHub.

**Example for adding a new physics experiment:**
```html
<li>
  <a class="tile" href="./new-experiment/index.html">
    <div class="image-holder"><img src="new-experiment/thumbnail.png" alt="Description"></div>
    <div class="information">
      <div class="title-holder"><span class="title">Experiment Name</span></div>
      <div class="icons">...</div>
    </div>
  </a>
</li>
```
